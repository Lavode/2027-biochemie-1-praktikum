	abstract = "The effect of several aminoglycoside antibiotics on ribonuclease P (RNase P) was investigated using an in vitro experimental system from Dictyostelium discoideum. Detailed kinetic analysis showed that all aminoglycosides tested (tobramycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, paromomycin, neomycin) behave as classical non-competitive inhibitors, with neomycin being the strongest inhibitor. The inhibition effect is attributed to the electrostatic competition of the cationic aminoglycosides with magnesium ions required for catalysis. Increasing Mg2+ ion concentrations reduced the effect of aminoglycosides on RNase P activity. Detailed kinetic analysis showed that aminoglycosides compete with Mg2+ for common binding sites on RNase P holoenzyme."
