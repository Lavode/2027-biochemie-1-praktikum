	abstract = "Mitochondria are made up of two membrane systems that subdivide this organelle into two aqueous subcompartments: the matrix, which is enclosed by the inner membrane, and the intermembrane space, which is located between the inner and the outer membrane. Protein import into mitochondria is a complex reaction, as every protein has to be routed to its specific destination within the organelle. In the past few years, studies with mitochondria of Neurospora crassa and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have led to the identification of four distinct translocation machineries that are conserved among eukaryotes. These translocases, in a concerted fashion, mediate import and sorting of proteins into the mitochondrial subcompartments."
