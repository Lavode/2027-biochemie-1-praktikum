\chapter{Protocol}

\section{Sample preparation}

A cell suspension was prepared ahead of time, containing $2.5 \cdot 10^5$ cells
per \SI{180}{\ul}. A dilution of neuraminidase in glycobuffer was created, with
a concentration of \SI{0.5}{U \per \ul}.

Then, four samples were prepared according to the following table.
\\

\begin{tabu}{lllll}
	\toprule
	Sample & N-1 & N-2 & N+1 & N+2 \\
	\midrule
	Cell suspension & \SI{180}{\ul} & \SI{180}{\ul} & \SI{180}{\ul} & \SI{180}{\ul} \\
	Neuraminidase dilution & \SI{0}{\ul} & \SI{0}{\ul} & \SI{20}{\ul} & \SI{20}{\ul} \\
	Glycobuffer & \SI{20}{\ul} & \SI{20}{\ul} & \SI{0}{\ul} & \SI{0}{\ul} \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabu}
\\

The four samples were mixed on a vortexer, and incubated for \SI{30}{\minute}
at \SI{37}{\celsius}, to facilitate activity of the neuraminidase.

\section{Virus internalisation}

\SI{10}{\ul} of a MVM-infected supernatant, with a concentration of $10^7$
virions per \si{\ul}, were added to all samples. The samples were then mixed on
a vortexer, and incubated for \SI{1}{\hour} at \SI{37}{\celsius}.

\section{Washing the samples}

In order to remove excess virus, the samples were washed thrice. During each
cycle they were first centrifuged at \SI{3000}{g} for \SI{3}{\min}, the
supernatant then discarded and the pellets resuspended in \SI{900}{\ul} ice-cold
PBS. After the final washing cycle, the supernatant was removed.

\section{Lysis with Chelex}

Through rapid pipetting, a provided chelex suspension of \SI{100}{\mg \per \ml}
was homogenized, and \SI{500}{\ul} transferred to a separate tube. This
solution was homogenized once more, and \SI{100}{\ul} were added to each
sample. The samples were vortexed, and incubated for \SI{10}{\min} at
\SI{95}{\celsius}, while shaking at \SI{400}{\rpm}.

Afterwards the samples were cooled down to prevent vapor build-up, vortexed
once more, and centrifuged for \SI{1}{\min} at \SI{15000}{\rpm}.

\SI{25}{\ul} of the supernatant, containing the DNA, was added to a separate
tube.

\section{Preparation of qPRC master-mix}

Two types of qPRC master-mix were prepared. The first one contained iTaq-mix,
forward primer and reverse primer, the second one was identical except it did
not contain reverse primer.

Composition of the first primer:
\\

\begin{tabu}{lll}
	\toprule
	Component & Fractions & Volume \\
	\midrule
	iTaq mix & 16 & \SI{112}{\ul} \\
	Forward primer MVM-F & 1 & \SI{7}{\ul} \\
	Reverse primer MVM-R-489 & 1 & \SI{7}{\ul} \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabu}
\\

Composition of the second primer:
\\

\begin{tabu}{lll}
	\toprule
	Component & Fractions & Volume \\
	\midrule
	iTaq mix & 16 & \SI{112}{\ul} \\
	Forward primer MVM-F & 1 & \SI{7}{\ul} \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabu}

\section{Preparation of PCR samples}

\SI{18}{\ul} of the first master-mix were added to five wells. Afterwards the
four samples, plus pure \ce{H2O} as a negative control, were added to these
wells.

\SI{17}{\ul} each of the second master-mix were added to six additional wells.
\SI{1}{\ul} of different reverse primers were added, with MVM-R-72 being added
to wells 6 and 7, MVM-R-432 to wells 8 and 9, and MVM-R-1037 to wells 10 and
11. Afterwards \SI{2}{\ul} of the samples without neuraminidase were added to
those wells, with sample 1 being added to wells 6, 8, 10, and sample 2 being
added to wells 7, 9 and 11.

In summary, the following wells were prepared:
\\

\begin{tabu}{lccccccccccc}
	\toprule
	Well & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\
	\midrule 
	iTaq Mix & \SI{16}{\ul} & \SI{16}{\ul} & \SI{16}{\ul} & \SI{16}{\ul} & \SI{16}{\ul} & \SI{16}{\ul} & \SI{16}{\ul} & \SI{16}{\ul} & \SI{16}{\ul} & \SI{16}{\ul} & \SI{16}{\ul} \\
	MVM-F & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} \\
	MVM-R-489 & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} &  &  &  &  &  &  \\

	MVM-R-432 & & & & & & & & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} & & \\
	MVM-R-1037 & & & & & & & & & & \SI{1}{\ul} & \SI{1}{\ul} \\
	N$+$ 1 & \SI{2}{\ul} & & & & & & & & & & \\
	N$+$ 2 & & \SI{2}{\ul} & & & & & & & & & \\
	N$-$ 1 & & & \SI{2}{\ul} & & & \SI{2}{\ul} & & \SI{2}{\ul} & & \SI{2}{\ul} & \\
	N$-$ 2 & & & & \SI{2}{\ul} & & & \SI{2}{\ul} & & \SI{2}{\ul} & & \SI{2}{\ul} \\
	\ce{H2O} & & & & & \SI{2}{\ul} & & & & & & \\
